      locations: A column name to use for location values.
      locationmode: A location mode to use.
        One of ‘ISO-3’, ‘USA-states’, or ‘country names’.
        These map locations to predefined geographic regions.
      geojson: GeoJSON data to use for geographic regions.
      featureidkey: The feature ID key to use for geographic regions.
      by: A column or list of columns that contain values to plot the figure traces by.
        All values or combination of values map to a unique design. The variable
        by_vars specifies which design elements are used.
        This is overriden if any specialized design variables such as color are specified
      by_vars: A string or list of string that contain design elements to plot by.
        Can contain size, color, and symbol.
        If associated maps or sequences are specified, they are used to map by column values
        to designs. Otherwise, default values are used.
      color: A column or list of columns that contain color values.
        If only one column is passed, and it contains numeric values, the value
        is used as a value on a continuous color scale. Otherwise, the value is
        used for a plot by on color.
        See color_discrete_map for additional behaviors.
      symbol: A column or list of columns that contain symbol values.
        The value is used for a plot by on symbol.
        See color_discrete_map for additional behaviors.

      labels: A dictionary of labels mapping columns to new labels.
      color_discrete_sequence: A list of colors to sequentially apply to
        the series. The colors loop, so if there are more series than colors,
        colors will be reused. This is overriden if "color" is specified.
      color_discrete_map: If dict, the keys should be strings of the column values (or a tuple
        of combinations of column values) which map to colors.
        If "identity", the values are taken as literal colors.
        If "by" or ("by", dict) where dict is as described above, the colors are forced to by

        of combinations of column values) which map to symbols.

        and 1 is completely opaque.
      projection: The projection type to use.
        Default depends on scope.
        One of 'equirectangular', 'mercator', 'orthographic', 'natural earth',

      title: The title of the chart
      template: The template for the chart.
      unsafe_update_figure: An update function that takes a plotly figure
        as an argument and optionally returns a plotly figure. If a figure is
        not returned, the plotly figure passed will be assumed to be the return
        value. Used to add any custom changes to the underlying plotly figure.

        This is overriden if any specialized design variables such as color are specified
      by_vars: A string or list of string that contain design elements to plot by.
        Can contain size, line_dash, width, color, and symbol.
        If associated maps or sequences are specified, they are used to map by column values
        to designs. Otherwise, default values are used.
      color: A column or list of columns that contain color values.
        If only one column is passed, and it contains numeric values, the value
        is used as a value on a continuous color scale. Otherwise, the value is
        used for a plot by on color.
        See color_discrete_map for additional behaviors.
      symbol: A column or list of columns that contain symbol values.
        The value is used for a plot by on symbol.
        See color_discrete_map for additional behaviors.
      size: A column or list of columns that contain size values.
        If only one column is passed, and it contains numeric values, the value
        is used as a size. Otherwise, the value is used for a plot by on size.
        See size_map for additional behaviors.
      width: A column or list of columns that contain width values.
        If only one column is passed, and it contains numeric values, the value
        is used as a width. Otherwise, the value is used for a plot by on width.
        See width_map for additional behaviors.
      line_dash: A column or list of columns that contain line_dash values.
        If only one column is passed, and it contains numeric values, the value
        is used as a line_dash. Otherwise, the value is used for a plot by on line_dash.
        See line_dash_map for additional behaviors.
      text: A column that contains text annotations.
      hover_name: A column that contains names to bold in the hover tooltip.
      labels: A dictionary of labels mapping columns to new labels.
      color_discrete_sequence: A list of colors to sequentially apply to
        the series. The colors loop, so if there are more series than colors,
        colors will be reused. This is overriden if "color" is specified.
      color_discrete_map: If dict, the keys should be strings of the column values (or a tuple
        of combinations of column values) which map to colors.
      symbol_sequence: A list of symbols to sequentially apply to the
        markers in the series. The symbols loop, so if there are more series than
        symbols, symbols will be reused. This is overriden if "symbol" is specified.
      symbol_map: If dict, the keys should be strings of the column values (or a tuple
        of combinations of column values) which map to symbols.
      size_sequence: A list of sizes to sequentially apply to the
        markers in the series. The sizes loop, so if there are more series than
        sizes, sizes will be reused. This is overriden if "size" is specified.
      size_map: If dict, the keys should be strings of the column values (or a tuple
        of combinations of column values) which map to symbols.
      width_sequence: A list of widths to sequentially apply to the
        markers in the series. The widths loop, so if there are more series than
        widths, widths will be reused. This is overriden if "width" is specified.
      width_map: If dict, the keys should be strings of the column values (or a tuple
        of combinations of column values) which map to symbols.
      line_dash_sequence: A list of line_dashes to sequentially apply to the
        markers in the series. The widths loop, so if there are more series than
        widths, widths will be reused. This is overriden if "line_dash" is specified.
      line_dash_map: If dict, the keys should be strings of the column values (or a tuple
        of combinations of column values) which map to line_dash.
      zoom: The zoom level of the map.
      center: A dictionary of center coordinates.
        The keys should be 'lat' and 'lon' and the values should be floats
        that represent the lat and lon of the center of the map.
      mapbox_style: The style of the map.

      title: The title of the chart
      template: The template for the chart.
      unsafe_update_figure: An update function that takes a plotly figure
        as an argument and optionally returns a plotly figure. If a figure is
        not returned, the plotly figure passed will be assumed to be the return
        value. Used to add any custom changes to the underlying plotly figure.
        Note that the existing data traces should not be removed. This may lead
        to unexpected behavior if traces are modified in a way that break data
        mappings.
