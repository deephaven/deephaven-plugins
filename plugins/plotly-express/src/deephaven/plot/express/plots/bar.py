    Args:
      table: A table to pull data from.
      x: A column or list of columns that contain x-axis values.
      y: A column or list of columns that contain y-axis values.
      by: A column or list of columns that contain values to plot the figure traces by.
        All values or combination of values map to a unique design. The variable
        by_vars specifies which design elements are used.
        This is overriden if any specialized design variables such as color are specified
      by_vars: A string or list of string that contain design elements to plot by.
        Can contain color and pattern_shape.
        If associated maps or sequences are specified, they are used to map by column values
        to designs. Otherwise, default values are used.
      color: A column or list of columns that contain color values.
        If only one column is passed, and it contains numeric values, the value
        is used as a value on a continuous color scale. Otherwise, the value is
        used for a plot by on color.
        See color_discrete_map for additional behaviors.
      pattern_shape: A column or list of columns that contain pattern shape values.
        The value is used for a plot by on pattern shape.
        See pattern_shape_map for additional behaviors.
      error_x: A column with x error bar values.
        These form the error bars in both the positive and negative
        direction if error_x_minus is not specified, and the error bars in
        only the positive direction if error_x_minus is specified. None can be
        used to specify no error bars on the corresponding series.
      error_x_minus: A column with x error bar values.
        These form the error bars in the negative direction,
        and are ignored if error_x is not specified.
      error_y: A column with x error bar values.
        These form the error bars in both the positive and negative
        direction if error_y_minus is not specified, and the error bars in
        only the positive direction if error_y_minus is specified. None can be
        used to specify no error bars on the corresponding series.
      error_y_minus: A column with y error bar values.
        These form the error bars in the negative direction,
        and are ignored if error_y is not specified.
      text: A column that contains text annotations.
      hover_name: A column that contains names to bold in the hover tooltip.
      labels: A dictionary of labels mapping columns to new labels.
      color_discrete_sequence: A list of colors to sequentially apply to
        the series. The colors loop, so if there are more series than colors,
        colors will be reused.
      color_discrete_map: If dict, the keys should be strings of the column values (or a tuple
        of combinations of column values) which map to colors.
        If "identity", the values are taken as literal colors.
        If "by" or ("by", dict) where dict is as described above, the colors are forced to by
      pattern_shape_sequence: A list of patterns to sequentially apply
        to the series. The patterns loop, so if there are more series than
        patterns, patterns will be reused.
      pattern_shape_map: If dict, the keys should be strings of the column values (or a tuple
        of combinations of column values) which map to patterns.
        If "identity", the values are taken as literal patterns.
        If "by" or ("by", dict) where dict is as described above, the patterns are forced to by
      color_continuous_scale: A list of colors for a continuous scale
      range_color: A list of two numbers that form the endpoints of the color axis
      color_continuous_midpoint: A number that is the midpoint of the color axis
      opacity: Opacity to apply to all markers. 0 is completely transparent
        and 1 is completely opaque.
      barmode: If 'relative', bars are stacked. If 'overlay', bars are drawn on top
        of each other. If 'group', bars are drawn next to each other.
      log_x: A boolean or list of booleans that specify if
        the corresponding axis is a log axis or not. The booleans loop, so if there
        are more series than booleans, booleans will be reused.
      log_y: A boolean or list of booleans that specify if
        the corresponding axis is a log axis or not. The booleans loop, so if there
        are more series than booleans, booleans will be reused.
      range_x: A list of two numbers or a list of lists of two numbers
        that specify the range of the x axes. None can be specified for no range
        The ranges loop, so if there are more axes than ranges, ranges will
        be reused.
      range_y: A list of two numbers or a list of lists of two numbers
        that specify the range of the y axes. None can be specified for no range
        The ranges loop, so if there are more axes than ranges, ranges will
        be reused.
      text_auto: If True, display the value at each bar.
        If a string, specifies a plotly texttemplate.
      title:  The title of the chart
      template: The template for the chart.
      unsafe_update_figure: An update function that takes a plotly figure
        as an argument and optionally returns a plotly figure. If a figure is
        not returned, the plotly figure passed will be assumed to be the return
        value. Used to add any custom changes to the underlying plotly figure.
        Note that the existing data traces should not be removed. This may lead
        to unexpected behavior if traces are modified in a way that break data
        mappings.
