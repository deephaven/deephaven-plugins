# Histogram Plot

A histogram plot is a data visualization technique commonly used in statistics and data analysis to represent the distribution of a dataset. It consists of a series of contiguous, non-overlapping bars that provide a visual summary of the frequency or density of data points within predefined intervals or "bins." The number of bins used has a significant impact on the vizualization, and this number currently must be set manually.

Histogram plots are useful for:

1. **Data Distribution Analysis**: Histograms are a valuable tool to gain insights into the distribution of a dataset, making it easier to understand the central tendencies, spread, and skewness of the data.
2. **Identifying Outliers**: Histograms help in detecting outliers or anomalies in a dataset by highlighting data points that fall outside the typical distribution.
3. **Quantitative Comparison**: When comparing the distribution of multiple datasets or subsets, histograms provide a straightforward visual means of assessing differences in data patterns.
4. **Density Estimation**: Histograms can serve as the basis for density estimation methods, helping to model and understand underlying data distributions, which is crucial in statistical analysis and machine learning.
