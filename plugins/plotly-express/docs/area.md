title: Area Plot
---

An area plot, also known as a stacked area chart, is a data visualization that uses multiple filled areas stacked on top of one another to represent the cumulative contribution of distinct categories over a continuous interval or time period. This makes it valuable for illustrating the composition and trends within data, especially when comparing the distribution of different categories.

Area plots are useful for:

1. **Comparing Category Trends**: Use area plots to compare and track trends in different categories over time, providing a clear view of their cumulative contributions.
2. **Proportional Representation**: When you need to show the relative proportion of different categories within a dataset, area plots offer an effective means of visualizing this information.
3. **Data Composition**: Area plots are ideal for revealing the composition and distribution of data categories, making them useful in scenarios where the relative makeup of categories is crucial.
4. **Time Series Analysis**: For time-dependent data, area plots are valuable for displaying changes in categorical contributions and overall trends over time.
