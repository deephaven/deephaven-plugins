title: How to use Deephaven Express
---

[Deephaven Express](https://github.com/deephaven/deephaven-plugin-plotly-express) is a powerful plotting library built on top of [Plotly Express](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/) that enhances its capabilities by adding support for real-time Deephaven tables, automatic downsampling, and server-side data grouping and aggregation using the Deephaven query engine. This library seamlessly integrates real-time data from Deephaven with the interactive and expressive visualizations of Plotly Express, allowing you to easily plot or aggregate millions of data points.

## Features

- **Real-Time Deephaven Tables**: Deephaven Plotly Express enables direct integration with real-time Deephaven tables, allowing you to visualize and analyze data as it updates in real time.
- **Automatic Downsampling**: The library offers pixel accurate automatic downsampling that reduces the number of data points displayed, ensuring smooth and responsive visualizations even with large datasets.
- **Server-Side Data Grouping and Aggregation**: Deephaven Plotly Express leverages server-side processing capabilities to perform data grouping and aggregation directly within Deephaven, enabling efficient analysis of huge datasets without requiring data transfer.
- **Plotly Express Compatibility**: Built on top of Plotly Express, the library inherits its comprehensive set of features, enabling you to create stunning and interactive visualizations effortlessly. In most cases you can directly swap `px` for `dx` for instant compatibility.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Deephaven Plotly Express supports interactive features such as zooming, panning, and hovering, allowing you to explore and interact with your data conveniently.
- **Easy-to-Use API**: The library provides a simple and intuitive API, making it easy for users to generate a wide range of visualizations and customize them according to their specific needs.
- **Single entry point**: `import deephaven.plot.express as dx` and get easy access to all plotting functions and built-in demo datasets.

## Getting Started

To create a real-time plot using Deephaven Plotly Express, run the following example with Deephaven:

```python order=my_plot,my_table
import deephaven.plot.express as dx

# Deephaven express includes a number of generated data sets for examples
my_table = dx.data.stocks()

# Create a line plot, and assign colors by distinct values in the `sym` column
my_plot = dx.line(table=my_table, x="timestamp", y="price", color="sym")
```

In this example, we create a Deephaven table and create a line plot of `timestamp` against `price` with automatic downsampling. A trace is created for each value in the `sym` column, each of which has a unique color.
