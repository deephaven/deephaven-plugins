title: Ternary Line Plot
---

Ternary line plots are a data visualization technique that represents data in a triangular coordinate system. They display data as connected line segments within the triangular space, making them useful for visualizing relationships, trends, and compositional data that sum to a constant total. Ternary line plots are particularly valuable when dealing with data involving three mutually exclusive components or proportions.

Ternary line plots are useful for:

1. **Compositional Data Representation**: Ternary line plots are suitable for representing compositional data where the total proportion remains constant, allowing for the visualization of how components change relative to one another.
2. **Multivariate Data Analysis**: They are useful in multivariate data analysis to visualize relationships and trends among three variables or components that are interrelated.
3. **Optimization Studies**: Ternary line plots can be applied in optimization studies to understand how adjustments in the proportions of three components impact the overall composition, aiding in informed decision-making.
