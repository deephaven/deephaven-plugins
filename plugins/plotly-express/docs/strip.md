title: Strip Plot
---

In a strip plot, individual data points are displayed along a single axis, providing a clear view of the distribution of data points without the additional density estimation and summary statistics provided by a violin plot. While strip plots offer a detailed look at individual data points, they may not convey the overall distribution shape and density as effectively as a violin plot. The choice between strip plots and violin plots depends on the specific analytical needs and the level of detail required for data representation.

Strip plots are useful in various technical applications for:

1. **Individual Data Points**: Displaying individual data points along an axis, allowing for a detailed view of each data point in the dataset.
2. **Identifying Outliers**: Facilitating the easy identification of outliers and anomalies within the data, aiding in data quality assessment.
3. **Small to Moderate Dataset Visualization**: Suitable for datasets of small to moderate sizes where individual data points can be effectively represented.
4. **Comparing Data Categories**: Comparing the distribution and spread of data across different categories or groups, making it useful for categorical data analysis.
