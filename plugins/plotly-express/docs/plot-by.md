# Plot By

To plot multiple series from a table into a single chart, use the `by` parameter. This parameter accepts a column name or a list of column names. The chart will be partitioned by the values in the specified column(s), with one series for each unique value. Other parameters, such as `color` (for which `by` is an alias), `symbol`, `size`, `width`, and `line_dash` can also be used to partition the chart.
