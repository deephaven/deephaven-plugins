# Box Plot

A box plot, also known as a box-and-whisker plot, is a data visualization that presents a summary of a dataset's distribution. It displays key statistics such as the median, quartiles, and potential outliers, making it a useful tool for visually representing the central tendency and variability of data.

Box plots are useful for:

1. **Visualizing Spread and Center**: Box plots provide a clear representation of the spread and central tendency of data, making it easy to understand the distribution's characteristics.
2. **Identification of Outliers**: They are effective in identifying outliers within a dataset, helping to pinpoint data points that deviate significantly from the norm.
3. **Comparative Analysis**: Box plots allow for easy visual comparison of multiple datasets or categories, making them useful for assessing variations and trends in data.
4. **Robustness**: Box plots are robust to extreme values and data skewness, providing a reliable means of visualizing data distributions even in the presence of outliers or non-normal data.
