title: Layer plots
---

To "layer" or "stack" multiple plots on top of each other, use the `layer` function. This is useful if you want to combine multiple plots of different types into a single plot, such as a scatter plot and a line plot. By default, last plot given will be used for the layout. The `which_layout` parameter can be used to specify which plot's layout should be used. The `specs` parameter can be used to specify the domains of each plot.
