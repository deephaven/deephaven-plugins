# Funnel Plot

A funnel plot is a data visualization that represents a process with various stages and allows multiple stacked categories, showing the quantitative values or counts at each stage in a funnel shape. It is a useful tool for tracking the progression or attrition of data through different stages, providing a visual overview of data distribution within the process. A funnel area plot, on the other hand, is another visualization that represents data progressing through stages, but it uses filled polygons to depict the proportional quantity of data at each stage, making it a valuable tool for comparing the relative size of categories within a process but can only represent one category.

#### What are funnel plots useful for?

- **Progression Analysis**: When you need to analyze the progression, attrition, or conversion rates of data as it moves through different stages and by categories.
- **Sequential Processes**: Funnel plots are suitable for visualizing data within sequential processes, where data typically funnels through various stages.
- **Data Distribution**: When you want to gain insights into the distribution of data at each stage within a process, and you can represent multiple categories as stacked bars for comparative analysis.
- **Efficiency Assessment**: To assess the efficiency and effectiveness of a process, particularly when evaluating the attrition or conversion of elements at each stage.
