# Funnel Area Plot

A funnel area plot is a data visualization that is typically used to represent data where values progressively decrease or "funnel" through stages or categories. It takes the form of a series of horizontally aligned trapezoids or polygons, with each stage's area proportional to the quantity it represents, making it a useful tool for visualizing the attrition or progression of data through a sequential process.

Funnel area plots are useful for:

1. **Sequential Data**: When visualizing data that follows a sequential or staged progression.
2. **Progression Analysis**: For analyzing attrition, conversion rates, or transitions between stages.
3. **Efficiency Evaluation**: To assess the efficiency and effectiveness of a process or workflow.
4. **Data Funneling**: When representing data where values funnel through stages or categories.
