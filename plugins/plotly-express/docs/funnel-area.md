# Funnel Area Plot

A funnel area plot is a data visualization that is typically used to represent data where values progressively decrease or "funnel" through stages or categories. It takes the form of a series of horizontally aligned trapezoids or polygons, with each stage's area proportional to the quantity it represents, making it a useful tool for visualizing the attrition or progression of data through a sequential process.

#### What are funnel area plots useful for?

- **Sequential Data**: When visualizing data that follows a sequential or staged progression.
- **Progression Analysis**: For analyzing attrition, conversion rates, or transitions between stages.
- **Efficiency Evaluation**: To assess the efficiency and effectiveness of a process or workflow.
