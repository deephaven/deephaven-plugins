# Sub plots

Multiple sub plots can be combined into one plot using the `make_subplots` function. This function accepts multiple plot objects, and returns a single plot object. The plot objects can be any of the plot types supported by Deephaven Plotly Express. They can be arranged in a grid, or in a single row or column. The `shared_xaxes` and `shared_yaxes` parameters can be used to share axes between plots.
