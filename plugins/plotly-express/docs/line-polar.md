# Polar Line Plot

Polar line plots are a type of data visualization that represents data points on a polar coordinate system. They display data as connected line segments extending from the center of a circular plot, often used to illustrate relationships, trends, or patterns within data that have angular or periodic dependencies.

#### When are polar line plots appropriate?

Polar line plots are appropriate when the data contain a continuous variable represented in polar coordinates, with a radial and an angular component instead of the typical x and y components. Further, polar line plots are preferable to polar scatter plots when the explanatory variables are ordered.

#### What are polar line plots useful for?

- **Cyclical Data Analysis**: They are ideal for analyzing cyclical or periodic data, such as daily temperature fluctuations, seasonal patterns, or circular processes in physics and engineering.
- **Directional Data Representation**: Polar line plots are valuable for representing directional data, such as wind direction, compass bearings, or circular measurements, offering a clear way to visualize and analyze patterns.
- **Phase or Angular Relationships**: When assessing phase shifts, angular dependencies, or correlations in data, polar line plots provide an intuitive representation for understanding relationships within circular data.
- **Circular Data Exploration**: They can be used to explore and analyze data where the angular or periodic nature of the data is a significant aspect, making them useful in fields like meteorology, geophysics, and biology.

## Examples

### A basic polar line plot

```python order=wind_line,wind
import deephaven.plot.express as dx
wind = dx.data.wind() # import a ticking version of the Wind dataset

# create a polar line plot by specifying r and theta. `by` is used to separate data by groups
wind_line = dx.line_polar(wind, r="frequency", theta="direction", by="strength")
```
