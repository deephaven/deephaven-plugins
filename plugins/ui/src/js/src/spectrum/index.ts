/**
 * Wrappers for Spectrum components.
 * Used if we want to mediate some of the props values passed to the Spectrum components.
 * For example, we may want to debounce sending the change for a text field, and also keep the value on the client side until the change is sent.
 * Or in the case of event handlers, we may want to wrap the event handler to serialize the event correctly.
