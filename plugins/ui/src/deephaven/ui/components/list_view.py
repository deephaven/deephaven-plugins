    """
    A list view that can be used to create a list of items. Children should be one of three types:
    1. If children are of type `Item`, they are the list items.
    2. If children are of type `Table`, the values in the table are the list items.
        There can only be one child, the `Table`.
        The first column is used as the key and label by default.
    3. If children are of type `ItemTableSource`, complex items are created from the source.
        There can only be one child, the `ItemTableSource`.
        Supported `ItemTableSource` arguments are `key_column`, `label_column`, `description_column`,
        `icon_column`, and `actions`.

    Args:
        *children: The options to render within the list_view.
        density:
            Sets the amount of vertical padding within each cell.
        default_selected_keys:
            The initial selected keys in the collection (uncontrolled).
        selected_keys:
            The currently selected keys in the collection (controlled).
        selection_mode:
            By default `"MULTIPLE"`, which allows multiple selection.
            May also be `"SINGLE"` to allow only single selection, or `"None"`/`None` to allow no selection.
        render_empty_state:
            Sets what the `list_view` should render when there is no content to display.
        on_selection_change:
            Handler that is called when the selection changes.
        on_change:
            Alias of `on_selection_change`. Handler that is called when the selection changes.
        **props:
            Any other ListView prop, except items, dragAndDropHooks, and onLoadMore.

    Returns:
        The rendered ListView.
