        end: The logical end position of the element, depending on layout direction.
        z_index: The stacking order for the element
        is_hidden: Hides the element.
        id: The unique identifier of the element.
        UNSAFE_class_name: Set the CSS className for the element. Only use as a last resort. Use style props instead.
