    A picker that can be used to select from a list. Children should be one of five types:
    1. If children are of type `Item`, they are the dropdown options.
    2. If children are of type `SectionElement`, they are the dropdown sections.
    3. If children are of type `Table`, the values in the table are the dropdown options.
        There can only be one child, the `Table`.
        The first column is used as the key and label by default.
    4. If children are of type `PartitionedTable`, the values in the table are the dropdown options
        and the partitions create multiple sections. There can only be one child, the `PartitionedTable`.
        The first column is used as the key and label by default.
    5. If children are of type `ItemTableSource`, complex items are created from the source.
        There can only be one child, the `ItemTableSource`.
        Supported ItemTableSource arguments are `key_column`, `label_column`, `description_column`,
        `icon_column`, and `title_column`.

    Args:
        *children: The options to render within the picker.
        default_selected_key:
            The initial selected key in the collection (uncontrolled).
        selected_key:
            The currently selected key in the collection (controlled).
        on_selection_change:
            Handler that is called when the selection changes.
        on_change:
            Alias of `on_selection_change`. Handler that is called when the selection changes.
        **props:
            Any other Picker prop, except items.

    Returns:
        The rendered Picker.
