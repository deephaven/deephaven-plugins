# deephaven.ui

## A Python web framework for building real-time data-focused apps

`deephaven.ui` is a plugin for Deephaven that combines a reactive UI framework and a library of pre-built real-time data-focused components for creating data apps. Write scripts entirely in Python -- no front-end engineering Javascript or CSS required. It uses a React-like approach to building components and rendering them in the UI, allowing for the creation of reactive components that can be re-used and composed together, as well as reacting to user input from the UI.

## Key Features

- **Components**: Create user interfaces from components defined entirely with Python.
- **Live dataframe aware**: Components are live dataframe aware and can use Deephaven tables as a data source.
- **Reactive**: UI components automatically update when the underlying Python data changes.
- **Declarative**: Describe the UI as a function of the data and let the framework handle the rest.
- **Composable**: Combine and re-use components to build complex interfaces.
- **Wide range of components**: From simple text fields to complex tables and plots, the library has a wide range of components to build your app.

## Getting Started

You can run the example Docker container with either of the following commands, depending on your Deephaven version:

```bash
# For Deephaven < 0.37.0
docker run --rm --name deephaven-ui -p 10000:10000 --pull=always ghcr.io/deephaven/server-ui:latest

# For Deephaven >= 0.37.0
docker run --rm --name deephaven-ui -p 10000:10000 --pull=always ghcr.io/deephaven/server:latest
```

You'll need to find the link to open the UI in the Docker logs:

## Creating and using components

Get started by importing the `deephaven.ui` package as `ui`:

```python test-set=0
from deephaven import ui
```

The `ui` package contains many _components_, which you can display in the UI:

```python test-set=0
hello_world = ui.heading("Hello World!")
```

![Basic Hello World example.](_assets/hello_world.png)

By assigning the component to the `hello_world` variable, it displays in the UI in a panel named `hello_world`.

## Handling events

Write functions to handle events. To write a button that will print event details to the console when clicked:

```python test-set=0
my_button = ui.button("Click Me!", on_press=lambda e: print(f"Button was clicked! {e}"))
```

![Whenever the button is pressed, event details are printed to the console.](_assets/handling_events.png)

## Creating components

Use the `@ui.component` decorator to create your own custom components. This decorator wraps the function provided as a Deephaven component. For more details on the architecture, see [Architecture documentation](./architecture.md).

We can display a heading above a button as our custom component:

```python test-set=0
@ui.component
def ui_foo_bar():
    return [
        ui.heading("Click button below"),
        ui.button("Click Me!", on_press=lambda: print("Button was clicked!")),
    ]


foo_bar = ui_foo_bar()
```

## Using state

Often, you'll want to react to the button presses and update the display. For example, to count the number of times a button has been pressed, use `ui.use_state` to introduce a _state variable_ in your custom component:

```python skip-test
@ui.component
def ui_counter():
    count, set_count = ui.use_state(0)
    # ...
```

Returned from `ui.use_state` is a tuple with two values: the current state (`count`), and a function to update that state (`set_count`).

The first time the button is displayed, the count will be `0` because that is the initial value passed into `ui.use_state`. Call `set_count` to update the state:

```python skip-test
@ui.component
def ui_counter():
    count, set_count = ui.use_state(0)
    return ui.button(f"Pressed {count} times", on_press=lambda: set_count(count + 1))
```

When state is updated, deephaven.ui will call your component again to re-render with the new value. After clicking once, it will re-render with `count` set to `1`, then set to `2`, and so on.

Each individual component has its own state:

```python test-set=0
@ui.component
def ui_counter():
    count, set_count = ui.use_state(0)
    return ui.button(f"Pressed {count} times", on_press=lambda: set_count(count + 1))


c1 = ui_counter()
c2 = ui_counter()
```
