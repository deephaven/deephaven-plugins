# Footer

A footer for a document or section.

## Example

```python
from deephaven import ui

my_footer = ui.footer("Â© All rights reserved.")
```

## Content

The footer component represents a footer that inherits styling from its parent container. It accepts any renderable node, not just strings.

## Slots

`ui.footer` is intended to be used in container components with layouts that provide a slot for `ui.footer` (and other supported elements). These components handle the layout and styling of such elements for you. See [`ui.dialog`](./dialog.md#content) and [`ui.contextual_help`](./contextual_help#example) for examples of a footer used in the context of a container.
